# Ice Cream Online Store App

## Project Description

The Ice Cream Online Store App allows customers to order items online from the Ice Cream shop. Customers can add or remove items from their cart before placing an order, and the total cost of the order updates automatically as more items are added. Order data gets stored in a database, and an admin using the app can view the sales data to get an idea of which products sell best.
